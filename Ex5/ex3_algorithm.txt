Transform an infix expression to postfix notation

Suppose Q is an arithmetic expression in infix notation. We will create an equivalent postfix expression P by adding items to on the right of P. The new expression P will not contain any parentheses.

We will use a stack in which each item may be a left parenthesis or the symbol for an operation.

     Start with an empty stack.  We scan Q from left to right. 

     While (we have not reached the end of Q)
        If (an operand is found)
           Add it to P
        End-If
        If (a left parenthesis is found) 
           Push it onto the stack
        End-If
        If (a right parenthesis is found) 
           While (the stack is not empty AND the top item is
                  not a left parenthesis)
              Pop the stack and add the popped value to P
           End-While
           Pop the left parenthesis from the stack and discard it 
        End-If
        If (an operator is found)
           If (the stack is empty or if the top element is a left
               parenthesis)
              Push the operator onto the stack
           Else  
              While (the stack is not empty AND the top of the stack 
                     is not a left parenthesis AND precedence of the                  
                     operator <= precedence of the top of the stack)
                 Pop the stack and add the top value to P
              End-While
              Push the latest operator onto the stack     
           End-If  
        End-If
     End-While
     While (the stack is not empty)
        Pop the stack and add the popped value to P
     End-While

Notes:

At the end, if there is still a left parenthesis at the top of the stack, or if we find a right parenthesis when the stack is empty, then Q contained unbalanced parentheses and is in error.
Evaluate a postfix expression

Suppose P is an arithmetic expression in postfix notation. We will evaluate it using a stack to hold the operands.

     Start with an empty stack.  We scan P from left to right.

     While (we have not reached the end of P)
        If an operand is found
           push it onto the stack
        End-If
        If an operator is found
           Pop the stack and call the value A
           Pop the stack and call the value B
           Evaluate B op A using the operator just found.
           Push the resulting value onto the stack
        End-If
    End-While
    Pop the stack (this is the final value)

Notes:

At the end, there should be only one element left on the stack.
This assumes the postfix expression is valid.
